          "Othello's jealousy is manufactured by Iago - it comes from outside, not within",
          "Iago's jealousy is multi-layered: professional (Cassio's promotion), sexual (suspicions about Emilia), and possibly racial",
          "The handkerchief becomes a symbol of jealousy - a trivial object given tremendous significance",
